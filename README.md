# Reverse interview for Designers

This is a list of questions which may be interesting if you apply to a product design role.
The points are not ordered and many may not apply to a given position, or work type.
This is a based on https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview adapted for Designers (Visual and Product Designer). 
Basicaly the idea is to detect smells and red flags to avoid future problems.


If you asked something not listed here, send in a PR.

## Expected usage

- Check which questions are interesting for you specifically
- Check which answers you can find yourself online
- Otherwise ask

Definitely don't try to ask everything from the list. (Respect the interviewer's time and show initiative by finding answers on your own if they're already published)

Remember that things tend to be fluid, re-organizations happens often.
Using specific tools doesn't make them good designers, using fancy cool words maybe be also a red flag, for smoke selling
